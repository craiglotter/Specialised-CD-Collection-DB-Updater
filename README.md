Specialised CD Collection DB Updater
====================================

Specialised CD Collection DB Updater is a quick and dirty application used specifically to update my CD Collection access database from a Folder Listing With Size Report generated text file.

The input text file's format should be as follows:
XXXX (12.3 MB)
YYYZZZ (0.11 Kb)

Created by Craig Lotter, March 2006

Note: This is a specialised application for my personal usage.
